-- Description: this is the main file included in every jaluino project
-- that uses Jaluino Bee{z} "Zzzzz" hardware. Jaluino Beez is based on PIC 18F25K22.
-- This files performs basic setup to configure PIC, like setting clock speed
-- using internal oscillator, etc...
-- --
-- The idea is you just have to type "include jaluino_beez" and your chip
-- is configured and ready to be used !

-- Jaluino BeeZ is based on PIC18F25K22.
include 18f25k22                    -- target PICmicro
pragma target clock 64_000_000     -- oscillator frequency
-- configuration memory settings (fuses)

pragma target WDT      disabled     -- no watchdog
pragma target DEBUG    disabled     -- no debugging
pragma target LVP      disabled     -- no Low Voltage Programming
pragma target MCLR external        -- reset externally

_usec_delay(2000) -- wait PLL to settle

enable_digital_io()                -- make all pins digital I/O

-- Include official pin mapping. Since it's arbitrary, one may want to bypass it
-- and provides his own mapping, defining the following constant.
if defined(JALUINO_SKIP_PINMAP) == false then
   include jaluino_bee_pinmap
end if

-- that's all, PIC is ready !
