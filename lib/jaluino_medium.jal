-- Description: this is the main file included in every jaluino project
-- that uses Jaluino Medium hardware. Jaluino Medium is based on PIC 18F4550.
-- This files performs basic setup to configure PIC, like setting clock speed
-- to 48MHz, disable watchdog, etc...
-- --
-- The idea is you just have to type "include jaluino_medium" and your chip
-- is configured and ready to be used !

-- Jaluino Medium is based onPIC 18F4550
include 18f4550
-- Board embeds 20MHz external crystal. This is the external clock speed.
-- But thanks to some kind of Harry Potter magic incantation, we are able to
-- to tell the chip to run at 48MHz (!), whereas there's "just" a 20MHz crystal.
-- To keep it simple: remeber, Jaluino Medium runs at 48MHz
