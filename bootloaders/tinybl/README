Tiny Bootloader is a widely used bootloader for Microchip PICs. It is very small, efficient, reliable.
You can check for more at http://www.etc.ugal.ro/cchiculita/software/picbootloader.htm, where you'll 
find detailed usage instructions and a GUI you can download to upload your program to your board.

Alternatively, you can use a command line version available in "3rdparty" directory, named "tinbybld2".

Depending on your Jaluino board, you'll have to select the appropriate bootloader PIC file to program.
Other parameters like clock speed, PLL, serial baudrate may also come in consideration, but using
defaults should give you a working bootloader-ready board:

 - Jaluino Medium: 18f4550/tinybld18f4550_20mhz_external_48mhz_pll_115k.hex
