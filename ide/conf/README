This directory contains several Editra configuration files,
used to provide Jalv2 Lexer, executable handlers and other 
specific launch commands.

These files should be deployed in Editra's cache directory:

  - Macintosh OSX
        ~/Library/Application Support/Editra/cache/
  
  - Linux/Unix
        ~/.Editra/cache/
  
  - Windows
        C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\Editra\cache\
