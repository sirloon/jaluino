How to bundle JaluinoIDE in Editra for Windows
----------------------------------------------

First perform a "make release VERSION=X.Y.Z" under Linux. This will produce usual
zip and tar.gz files, and a remaining "jaluino-X.Y.Z" directory from where 
installer will pick content.

Prepare Editra. Checkout sources from SVN, http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxPython/3rdParty/Editra,
in "3rdparty" directory so there's a "3rdparty/Editra" directory containing all sources.

Apply patches (under Linux):

    cd tools/installer
    ./patch_editra.sh

(comes from "svn diff ../../3rdparty/Editra > editra_patch.diff"

In a first step, Editra must be compiled using py2exe. Go to "3rdparty/Editra" with cmd and run:

   c:\python26\python.exe setup.py clean
   c:\python26\python.exe setup.py py2exe

This requires wxPython2.8 (unicode).

Once built, go to "tools/installer" and compile jaluinoide.nsi (right-click, "Compile").
File "jaluinoide-X.Y.Z.exe" is created, approx ~30MB.
