Few words about how to build a Jaluino release...

Under Linux:

 $ cd tools
 $ make release VERSION=X.Y.Z

This builds source tarball and zip archives.

Then, under Windows, "jaluino" directory must be accessible (Samba share).
Run "cmd":

 $ cd path\to\jaluino\3rdparty\Editra
 $ c:\python26\python.exe setup.py py2exe

Then compile NSIS installer script. "jaluinoide.X.Y.Z.exe" is created.

Upload archives and installer.

Celebrate.
