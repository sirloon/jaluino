jaluino-next:
------------

mainboard:
 - added pin numbers, updated labels

documentation:
 - updated to include pin numbers

shields:
 - jallib shield: experiment most PIC features with this shield, and
   learn to use jallib with: push buttons, PWM with power output, ADC,
   I2C with RTC, LCD, 7-segment displays, ...
 - stepper shield: drive a stepper motor

libraries:
 - jaluino_medium_pinmap.jal: mapping between PIC pins and numbers
 - firmata.jal: first implementation of Firmata protocol for Jaluino

samples
 - firmata demo, crumboard samples, ...
