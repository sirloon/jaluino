                <p><b>Crumboard</b> shield is a prototyping shield designed for Jaluino. It embeds a small breadboard (thus the name, crumb-board...), two LEDs and two Push-buttons.</p>
                <p>This shield is useful to test new hardware designs. It&apos;s also a nice base to learn how to use Jaluino and get started with PIC microcontrollers, experimenting very basic tutorials such as famous &quot;blink-a-led&quot;, and read input from a push-button. Definitely a  <i>must-have</i>!</p>

      <title>Schematic and PCB</title>
      <p>Crumboard includes two LEDs and two push-buttons, as exposed in the following  schematic:</p>

      <p>LEDs and push-buttons can be activated using jumpers JP1, JP2, JP3 and JP4.</p>
      <p>PCB shouldn&apos;t be a problem to build. You can access 1:1 scale Crumboard <xref href="http://jaluino.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shields/crumboard/Crumboard_pcb.pdf" format="pdf">PCB</xref> and <xref href="http://jaluino.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shields/crumboard/label_for_crumboard.pdf" format="pdf">labels</xref>, PDF format, on <xref href="http://code.google.com/p/jaluino/source/browse/trunk/shields/crumboard/" format="html">Jaluino SVN repository</xref>.</p>

      <title>Building Crumboard</title>
      <p>Crumboard is quite an easy to build. Since Jaluino is aimed to be cheap, we also give special attention in order to provide this prototyping shield with minimal cost.</p>
      <p>Building PCB itself isn&apos;t explained here, the following step-by-step focuses on how to deal with integrating the breadboard. You can buy a small one that would fit within shield connectors, but it often the same as a  standard one. Some standard breadboards can be cut to fit shield size, for lower cost...</p>

              <entry>
                <p>As first step, you&apos;ll have to find a breadboard like the one shown on the photo. It&apos;s a very common model. Be sure it can be cut.</p>

              <entry>Start to draw a line with a black paper. This is where you&apos;ll cut the breadboard. You need to get a length of about 2,7&quot; (6,8cm), just measure what you need on the board itself.</entry>

              <entry>Depending on your breadboard model, you may need to remove one power lines part. Usually, you have two of them, on the left and right. Keeping both may give a breadboard too large top fit within shield connectors. </entry>

              </entry>
              <entry>With one power lines part removed, breadboard will fit perfectly... Make sure to also remove the small remaining plastic part to get a clean surface.</entry>

              <entry>
                <p>You&apos;re done, just stick it between shield connectors. Some breadboards have a sticky surface, but it not, just use some strong glue.</p>
                <p>Now the best for the end, you can build two crumboard with one standard breadboard ! Having multiple crumboards can be very useful when you work on multiple projects and design versions. Switching between them is easy: unplug a crumboard, plug another...</p>

      <title>Using Crumboard</title>
      <p>Crumboard can be used like any breadboard, but also provide LEDs and push-buttons to experiment inputs and outputs easily (TODO: links to upcoming Jaluino tutorials). This is an essential shield when getting started with PICs.</p>
      <p>Crumboard can also be used to test rather complex designs, like this one prototyping a bluetooth device...</p>
