# this files is used to declare which DITA files should be published to the website.
# it works as following:
#  - empty lines or lines starting with "#" are ignored (comments)
#  - other lines are composed by (fields separated by spaces, whatever the number):
#      1. the relative path to the DITA xml file
#      2. a python configutation file, remaining in "tools/japp" (just the filename, not the whole path)
#         (because this file contains passwords, it's not in the repos, only the template is, so don't worry
#         if you can't find it)
#      3. a timestamp field: in order to know which lines have changed within this files, a timestamp
#         field is used, by convention, it looks like "YYYYMMDDNN", something like DNS config files
#         Ex: 2010012501, 2010012502, etc...
#
# If you modified a DITA xml file, in order to publish it, you need to edit this file, add a new line if 
# it doesn't exist (alphabetical order please), or update timestamp
#
# A special DITA is the "ditamap". From this file a Table Of Content (TOC) is extracted and generated. If
# a new line has been added (a new page to publish), then also update ditamap's timestamp so the TOC
# is generated.
