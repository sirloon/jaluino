      <p>Just like Arduino, you can build your own version of Jaluino derived from original reference designs. But we&apos;d like to keep the name &quot;<i>Jaluino</i>&quot; strictly related to original designs, those coming from Jaluino Team/Group, in order to maintain our own official standards.</p>
