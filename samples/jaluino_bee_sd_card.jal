-- Description: SD-Card demo, running MSSP2 with PPS module:
-- - RBO / RP3: /SS2 (I)
-- - RA5 / RP2: SCK2 (I & O)
-- - RB2 / RP5: SDI2 (I)
-- - RB3 / RP6: SDO2 (O)
-- Sample will write incrementing values, beginning at sector 20. Once written,
-- it'll read them back and check values. If value is correct, LED is blinking fast.
-- You can also check SD-card content, running "hexdump -v -C /dev/<sdcard-device> | less"
-- under Linux, or something similar under Windows.
-- You'll see values at address 0x2800 (which 20 sectors * 512 bytes = 10240 = 0x2800)
-- .
-- Expected behavior:
-- 1. LED is flashing once (write bytes)
-- 2. small delay
-- 3. LED is blinking very fast, for ~20 seconds (read and check values)
-- 4. LED is blinking sloooowly for 5 seconds (pause before restarting)
